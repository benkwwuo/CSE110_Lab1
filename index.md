# Introduction 
A transfer student from Mount San Antonio Community College to UCSD in the year 2020 as a B.A
student in Computer Science with no particular interest as of yet. I'm still exploring the vast
field that is CS as I believe the skills I've learned and are currently learning can be applied
in most if not all fields. But so far my interests lie in A.I, granted I have little experience, 
this seems the most interesting to me. 

# Potential interests in the CS field
* Work on projects that improve the living standards for people everywhere
* Help make the world more sustainable
* Blockchain
