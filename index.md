# GME 
The stock market is a fraud and those behind the massive short selling are the same entities that caused the housing crisis back in 2008. 
In addition, we are currently underway to reliving 2008 but at a far greater magnitude. The DTCC, SEC, Fed, and other government and 
non-government entities are complicit and have allowed countless illegal activites to persist in not only US markets but in foreign ones
as well. This is not a conspiracy theory as extensive research has dated back since the creation of the stock market. For more information,
